# Setting up the development Environment

1. Ensure you have Node installed on your machine (at least v16 or above)
2. Ensure you have prettier setup
3. Have a phone with Expo Go installed and logged in
4. Make sure both your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network

# Running

1. `cd` into the this (the frontend) directory.
2. Run the command `npm install` inside.
3. Create a file `env.ts` in the root of the this directory or rename `env.ts.template` to `env.ts`.
4. Set the exported constant to the URL that should be used as the target Oui-Eat server. If hosting the server locally, the network IP of the server should appear in the console.
5. Run `npx expo start` or `npm start`.


# Contributing

-   Pages go inside the `src/pages/PageName`
-   A page contains `components` and `assets` directories
-   It also contains 4 files in the root directory:
    -   A model file that stores all the data used by the page
    -   A controller file that stores all the data manipulation logic
    -   A view file that is whatâ€™s rendered to the user
    -   An index file that exports the contents of this page from the directory
-   The authentication state is managed a React context that is initialized at the root of the application.
-   The root of the application is also where the routes are managed and initialized
